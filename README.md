# T Prehl's TOP Projects

This repository was created with the purpose of housing all of the projects I created while progressing through the The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Each main folder represents a single project. For example, Landing-Page represents the project titled "Project: Landing Page" in the TOP Foundations Course.
